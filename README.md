## About

- EnviSafe is an AI powered environmental health guardian capable of generating customized environmental health reports.
- Each report is tailored to the user, and does so by leveraging multiple API databases (weather, UV, pollen) grabbing real time environmental data as well as user location (either automatically from device IP address or manually inputted for any possible global location) and an inputted user health-profile.
- With this EnviSafe generates a user-tailored report with potential health risks and precautionary recommendations.
